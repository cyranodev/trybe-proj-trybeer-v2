## Requisites

**First version:** this version follows up an initial one where the whole project is built up>

- *Back-end:* usage of [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) was required. The group decided to use a services layer in architecture and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to handle routes. We implemented basic security features such as [JWT](https://jwt.io/) for login management, as well as encryption of passwords (using [BCrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)) to store them in DB, and our own log middleware (developed by Phelipe Ohlsen, see contributors below) to write logs and handle errors within Express flow. 

- *Front-end:* all elements built up using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and *React Context*, along with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to deal with routes and protected (logged in) routes. Visual design was not a requirement in itself
  
**Set-up for current version:** the current version required a migration from mySQL to [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) beforehand, so the group had to create Sequelize models and migrations in order to allow seeders for automated tests to work (tests provided by Trybe to assess students' performance).

**Requisites sum-up:**

- Improve existing features to allow clients to see their orders' status and admin users to change that status among three possible values
- Create a chat feature for clients to chat with the store:
  - each client only chats with the 'store' and all chats are private
  - admin users can see all chats and send messages to clients
  - mongoDB is required to store chats
- Back-end unit tests (we mainly used endpoint tests with Jest and Supertest to track coverage across architecture layers)

## Instructions

Clone the repo or download the zip.

Run `npm install`. (which means *Node.js* must be installed in your machine)

To start the back-end: go to *back-end* project folder and run `npm start`.
To start the front-end: go to *front-end* project folder and run `npm start`.
To run back-end tests (with coverage report): go to *back-end* project folder and run `npm run test-coverage`.
## Important: mongoDB and mySQL services must be installed and active in your machine in order for DBs (and the whole project) to work.
